This is a web application, so deployments can be done in a numebr of ways.

My test rig is a CentOS Linux server.

Install CentOS 7 Minimal (I used a VirtualBoxInstance)
	http://mirrors.greenmountainaccess.net/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1503-01.iso

I install the GNOME Desktop Environment, because I like GUI's
	> yum groupinstall "GNOME Desktop" "Graphical Administration Tools"
	Enable GUI on system start up. In CentOS 7,  systemd uses ‘targets’ instead of
	runlevels; /etc/inittab file is no more used to change run levels. Issue the following
	command to enable the GUI on system start.
	> ln -sf /lib/systemd/system/runlevel5.target /etc/systemd/system/default.target
	reboot


On the centos server

	Install apache httpd
		yum -y install httpd
	
		in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, add the following to allow access to solr, tomcat and dojo
	
		ProxyPass         /gallery  http://localhost:8080/gallery
		ProxyPassReverse  /gallery  http://localhost:8080/gallery
		
		ProxyPass         /dojo1.10.0src  http://localhost:8080/dojo1.10.0src
		ProxyPassReverse  /dojo1.10.0src  http://localhost:8080/dojo1.10.0src

		ProxyPass         /solr  http://localhost:8983/solr
		ProxyPassReverse  /solr  http://localhost:8983/solr

	Install Tomcat (8?)
		Deploy the Gallery
		Deploy dojo
		
	I have tomcat8 running
		This is where I have the Gallery deployed, and I have dojo deployed there as well.
	I have solr running in a jetty instance.
		I was not looking for elegance here, but a simple way to have SOLR running, so this was my solution.	
	 	SOLR: 
			ftp://ftp.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.apache.org/lucene/solr/4.10.1/solr-4.10.1.tgz
			to
			/home/mike.hampton/Downloads
			
			I Unzipped/untarred it to /usr/local/solr-4.10.1
				in a terminal, I sudo to a new shell to become root
					sudo bash
					cd /usr/local
					tar -zxvf /home/mike.hampton/Downloads/solr-4.10.1.tgz
	
			Copy solr-image-index.zip to the linux test machine, and unzip it to /usr/local/solr-image-index
				cd /usr/local 
				unzip <path to file>/solr-image-index.zip
	
			The command script to start solr is in solr-image-index/runSolr.sh
				Made sure it is executable
					chmod +x solr-image-index/runSolr.sh
				This has the correct paths to use this directory, plus one additional property
				'-Dsolr.appDir="<solr-home>"'.  This is used in solr-image-index/solr/collection1/conf/solrconfig.xml
	
			The command script to stop solr is solr-image-index/stopSolr.sh
				Made sure it is executable
					chmod +x solr-image-index/stopSolr.sh

			Ensure the machine IP is in /etc/hosts
				Had to add the line
					"192.168.1.110 ISS203716" to /etc/hosts
			
			http://localhost:8983/solr is the web interface for solr
