This is a web application, so deployments can be done in a numebr of ways.

My test rig is a CentOS Linux server.

On the centos server

	I have apache httpd running.
	
		in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, I have the following to allow access to solr, tomcat and dojo
	
		ProxyPass         /gallery  http://localhost:8080/gallery
		ProxyPassReverse  /gallery  http://localhost:8080/gallery
		
		ProxyPass         /dojo1.10.0src  http://localhost:8080/dojo1.10.0src
		ProxyPassReverse  /dojo1.10.0src  http://localhost:8080/dojo1.10.0src

		ProxyPass         /solr  http://localhost:8983/solr
		ProxyPassReverse  /solr  http://localhost:8983/solr

		
	I have tomcat8 running
		This is where I have the Gallery deployed, and I have dojo deployed there as well.
	I have solr running in a jetty instance.
		I was not looking for elegance here, but a simple way to have SOLR running, so this was my solution.	
	 	SOLR: 
			ftp://ftp.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.apache.org/lucene/solr/4.10.1/solr-4.10.1.tgz
			to
			/home/mike.hampton/Downloads
			
			I Unzipped/untarred it to /usr/local/solr-4.10.1
				in a terminal, I sudo to a new shell to become root
					sudo bash
					cd /usr/local
					tar -zxvf /home/mike.hampton/Downloads/solr-4.10.1.tgz
	
			I copied solr-image-index.zip to the linux machine, and unzipped it to /usr/local/solr-image-index
				cd /usr/local 
				unzip /media/MyPassport/data/solr-image-index.zip
	
			I made the command script to start solr: solr-image-index/runSolr.sh
				Made sure it was executable
					chmod +x solr-image-index/runSolr.sh
				This has the correct paths to use this directory, plus one additional property '-Dsolr.appDir="K:/solr-4.10.0"'.  This is used below.
	
			I made the command script to stop solr: solr-image-index/stopSolr.sh	
				Made sure it was executable
					chmod +x solr-image-index/stopSolr.sh
	
			Had to add the line
			"192.168.1.110 ISS203716" to /etc/hosts, because it was not already there.
			
			http://localhost:8983/solr is the web interface
